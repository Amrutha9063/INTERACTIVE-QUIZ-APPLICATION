"The Interactive Quiz Application is a simple yet engaging web-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to test their knowledge through multiple-choice questions while receiving instant feedback. The structure of the quiz is created with HTML, styled attractively with CSS using colors, layouts, and hover effects, and made interactive with JavaScript, which dynamically loads questions, validates answers, calculates scores, and manages the restart functionality. The application displays one question at a time with four options, highlights correct and incorrect answers instantly, and shows a final score at the end with an option to replay the quiz. Tools like Visual Studio Code were used for coding and web browsers like Chrome were used for testing. This project highlights how front-end technologies can be combined to create an interactive, educational, and entertaining application without requiring a backend or external libraries, making it lightweight, portable, and user-friendly."
